# Code Refactor Starter Code
## Description
This project shows refactored code to make the HTML and CSS code more presentable, understandable and, if required, easier to amend in the future.

Semantic HTML has been used wihtin the refactored code to make the code more comprehensible and allows search engines to interpret the content better.
For example: through my edits, I have introduced meaning to the header and footer.
